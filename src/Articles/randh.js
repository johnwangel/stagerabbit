            <h1>Rodgers and Hammerstein</h1>
            <div className='subttl'>Fathers of the Modern Musical</div>
            <p>Just about everyone knows Rodgers and Hammerstein.
              Starting with their first collaboration, <i>Oklahoma!</i>, in 1943,
              they transformed the musical from a light, trivial entertainment into
              the more substantial works of art that continues to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the sentimentality of Oscar Hammerstein II feels as corny as Kansas in August
              today, but these stories are still some of our most beloved stage shows. And there are
              few composers as gifted as Richard Rodgers in creating a melody that lingers in the memory
              and the heart. They were unafraid to tackle tough stories, from a lecherous farmhand in Oklahoma
              to an abusive theif in Carousel, from racism in South Pacific to fascism in The Sound of Music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following is a complete list of Rodgers and Hammerstein&rsquo;s collaborations.
            </p>


            <h2>The Sound of Music</h2>
            <p>The hills are alive! Who doesn&rsquo;t know every word to every song in <i>The Sound of Music</i>.
              Arguably R&H&rsquo; most popular work due to the mega-hit film from 1964, it tells the
              life-affirming story of Maria, a rebellious nun-turned-nanny, who turns the regimented von Trapp
              household upside-down when she brings music into the lives of Captain Georg von Trapp and his
              seven children. Music saves them when their beloved Austria succumbs to the Nazi threat. You know
              all the tunes: 'Do Re Mi', 'My Favorite Things', 'The Sound of Music', 'Climb Every Mountain', The Lonely Goatherd', 'Edelweiss'.

              groundbreaking in its time for seamlessly combining music, lyrics, dance, and drama.
              It&rsquo;s the simple story of Laurey trying to decide which of two suitors to take her to the
              box social, that becomes sinister when suitor Judd is overcome with jealousy. Timeless songs include the rousing anthem 'Oklahoma!', 'Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin', 'Surrey with a Fringe on Top', and 'People Will Say We&rsquo; in Love'.

            <p>
              You&rsquo;re in for some enchanted evening with <i>South Pacific</i>. Somewhat improbably
              based on James A. Michener&rsquo;s sprawling short story collection, <i>Tales of the South Pacific</i>,
              it is the story of a group of U.S. Seabies idling on a South Pacific island during World War II, and the blossoming

            <h2>Carousel</h2>
            <p>Their second collaboration, and another HUGE hit, <i>Carousel</i> is Rodgers and Hammerstein&rsquo;s most lust score.
            Based on <i>Liliom</i> by Hungarian playwright Ferenc Moln√°r, and reset in a New England factory town at the turn of the 19th century, this is a love story between carnival barker Billy Bigelow and millworker Julie Jordan. Despite Billy&rsquo;s
            love for Julie, his criminal past leads him astray. It takes the Greatest Judge of all to decide if he is worthy of
            redemption. Includes 'June is Bustin Out All Over', 'If I Loved You', and the rousing 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.
